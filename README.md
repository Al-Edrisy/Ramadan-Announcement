🌙 Ramadan Announcement 🌙

Assalamu Alaikum Brothers and Sisters,

As the blessed month of Ramadan approaches, we are delighted to announce that we will be conducting Tarawih prayers every night. During Tarawih, we will be completing one Juz' of the Quran per night, with the goal of completing the entire Quran by the end of Ramadan, insha'Allah.

🕌 Location: (https://maps.app.goo.gl/D56ZEMjBEdFQWLVQ9)
🗓️ Time: Time of Tarawih Prayers
📖 Recitation: One Juz' per night

We invite you and your family to join us in these special prayers and spiritual gatherings. Let us come together as a community to seek the blessings and mercy of Allah during this sacred month.

Please feel free to invite your friends and family to join us. May Allah accept our prayers and grant us the strength to make the most of this blessed month.

Jazakum Allahu Khairan.
